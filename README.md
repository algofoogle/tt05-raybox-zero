# raybox-zero for TT05 (Tiny Tapeout 05)

## Overview

This is an attempt to create a Verilog HDL design implementing a sort of GPU that is a one-trick pony: It is a very simple ray caster demo (sort of like Wolf3D rendering) driving a VGA display without a framebuffer (i.e. by 'racing the beam'). It's inspired by Wolf3D and based on Lode's popular Raycasting tutorial (https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html).

This doco is TBC!

Until I complete the doco, you can find much more detail in [the prior TT04 version](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-raybox-zero) and its README.


# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).
